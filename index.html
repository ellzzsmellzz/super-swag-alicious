<p> you can set a <b>hyperlink</b> like the one above by using the a tags and href command within the opening tag. after the opening tag you can write the text you'd like to hyperlink!</p>
    <!-- you can also add a description or title that appears when you hover your mouse over the link-->

<h1>we're gonna add images now using the img tag</h1>
    <hr>
        <img src="worm_for_site.jpg" height="300">
<p> if youve got your image files in the same folder as your html files, you can just use what you named it as in the img tag</p>
<p> there's another guy on the next page </p>
    <br>
<p><b>we're gonna add a little tune now using audio tags and controls</b></p>
<audio controls src="Xue_Hua_audio.mp3"></audio>
    <!--attributes like 'controls' or 'autoplay' are boolean attributes that are either true (1) or false (0) and when present in a command, they are recognised as true and will automatically be performed-->
    <!-- you can also add attributes like 'autoplay muted' or 'loop' to initially mute the audio, have it play automatically or even loop around-->
<p>you can do the same for video mp.4 files, and also nest sources of the same video under the same video tag or audio tag. the same boolean attributes can also be used with videos</p>
    <!--nesting sources (linking multiple sources to the same video) allows more support when using different browsers that may not support one of the listed sources-->
